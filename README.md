# Dyslexic/Synesthete Reader App

This is an app which is intended as a educational/empathy tool for displaying how writing shows up for a dyslexic/synesthete reader. The app should display a block of text, be it generic or user input, with a set of filters that change or distort the text in accordance with information about how someone might see the text while having those conditions. Those filters might be:

-   "Colouring" - each individual letter should have a colouring based on a given input; optionally, it should change when a user inputs a newly given color "library".
-   "Flickering" - Letters should flicker to different letters occasionally. Optionally, this would have a slider which makes it more pronounced or constant.
-   "Haze" - Letters become hazy and unfocused unless the mouse cursor is within a certain range. Optionally, the distance this happens from the mouse cursor could be adjustable.
-   "Jumping" - Words should jump around; either a line above where they are, or a word or two ahead of where they're currently are. Optionally, this would have a slider which makes it more pronounced or constant.

The website which displays this could optionally have a functionality for saving the inputs the user gives. Another option is a feedback form for suffers of dyslexia which sends information to a database, anonymized and can then be used for further effects for the website to display.
