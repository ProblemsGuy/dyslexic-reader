# Dyslexic Reader

Do you suffer from dyslexia, synesthesia, dyscrasia or other reading impeding disorders? Looking for something to help overcome the challenges you face in reading? No? Well then how about a tool to show others what you're working with.

Introducing "Dyslexic Reader", a tool designed around improving and enhancing empathy for dyslexia and associated conditions that can lead to difficulty in reading and writing.

To use the tool, enter in text in the input box and then click submit; the display works best with longer pieces of text, usually between 300 and 500 characters.

## Current Functionality

**Coloring**: Letters are colored in accordance with a given value. This reflects the sensory experience of synesthesia, and can often make the experience of reading overwhelming. To disable this or change a letter's color, go to the Options page.

**Hazing**: Letters will appear hazy and grainy unless the mouse is brought near. This reflects a dyslexic's increased need for concentration to read text, and how large blocks of text can be tricky to read. To disable this, go to the Options page.

**Jumping**: Words will jump whole lines up the page or shift position randomly. This is a common experience for dyslexics. To disable this, go to the Options page.

**Flickering**: Letters will flicker and change to other characters, making reading more difficult. This is another form of mental load for dyslexics. To disable this, go to the Options page.

## Planned Functionality

-   **Intensity Sliders**: Allow users to increase or lower the intensity and regularity of Flickering and Jumping, as well as how tight or broad the Haze window is.
-   **p-d-q-b & g-y Blindness**: Add a function to Flickering to cause specific switching between letters that are known for causing confusion for certain dyslexics.
-   **Capital Color Locking**: Allow colors of capital and lower case letters to be locked together in cases where users don't experience them as separate colors.
-   **Custom Character Input**: Allow users to input new characters in the Options menu so that they have access to all the colors they wish.
-   **Cookie Memory**: Using cookies (with user consent) to store Options as set, so the page can be reloaded without having to input all information again
